# Advanced-stable-diffusion-model

## Overview

Welcome to the Graphical Image App, a cutting-edge text-to-image model that generates graphical images based on simple prompts. This model utilizes the stable diffusion model, available on the [Hugging Face Model Hub](https://huggingface.co/models), containing various pre-trained text-to-image models to produce desired output images.

**Note:** `The model is hosted on a free-tier version, featuring a low-power CPU, which might result in longer loading times for image generation.`

## Technology Stack

### 1. Text-to-Image Models

The model is built using Hugging Face Hub models, specifically the stable diffusion model. This model leverages advanced techniques in text-to-image synthesis, allowing users to generate graphical images with ease.

### 2. Deployment on Hugging Face Spaces

The Graphical Image App is deployed on [Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces) for convenient access and sharing. You can interact with the model directly on our Hugging Face Space at [Your Hugging Face Space URL](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Saurabhgk18/AdvancedStable-Diffusion).

### 3. Gradio for Web UI

The user interface for our web app is powered by Gradio, a Python library that simplifies the creation of UIs for machine learning models. Gradio allows for easy integration and interaction with the text-to-image model, providing a seamless and intuitive experience for users.

## Features

- **Text-to-Image Generation:** Quickly generate graphical images by providing simple prompts.
- **Advanced Pre-trained Models:** The stable diffusion model contains various text-to-image pre-trained models to cater to different use cases.
- **Accelerated Performance:** The model is built using accelerators to boost time efficiency while maintaining accuracy comparable to other models.
